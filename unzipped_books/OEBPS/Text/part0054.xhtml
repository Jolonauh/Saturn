Cheryl is editing it right now.  Thank you for reading. Seriously. Please, please leave a review. <span class="underline">We live and die by our reviews</span>, and it’s super important. So if you read this and enjoyed it, please review it. It’s against Amazon’s rules to offer a prize to those who review books, but I will risk Amazon’s wrath and offer my services to be the father of your babies if you post a review. See you in ’21.</p>
